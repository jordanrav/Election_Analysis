## Election-Audit Summary
there are two ways that you can modify this script so that it can be more helpful for further elections. the first modification could be to see the divide for each county so that candidates can see which counties they have the most success in. the second modification could be to have a ranking system to see each votes 1st, 2nd, and 3rd candidate option to see which counties you have a better chance into swaying on your side and which counties are too far gone to fight over.
